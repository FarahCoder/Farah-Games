Hi! My name is Farah, and I am a passionate young coder. An Egyptian Australian who started her coding journey at 6 years old, I have learned to code on scratch, code.org,MIT App Inventor and Visual Studio Code using HTML, Python, and Javascript. My mum is an AI engineer and researcher and tends to talk a lot about Artificial Intelligence, which is why I took the love and passion of coding from my mother. I have worked for nearly a year to design all of the games (with help from my amazing tutor), so I hope you like my games! ENJOY!
